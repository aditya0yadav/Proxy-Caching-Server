 # Educational Proxy Caching Server

## Description

The **Educational Proxy Caching Server** is a lightweight project designed to teach the concepts of caching and proxy servers. It demonstrates how to optimize bandwidth usage, improve resource delivery speed, and reduce redundant requests by implementing a simple yet effective caching mechanism.

This project is ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of proxy caching servers in a practical and hands-on manner.
